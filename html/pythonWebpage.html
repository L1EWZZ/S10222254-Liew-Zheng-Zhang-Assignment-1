    <p class="descriptionParagraph">In November 2020, with some help from experienced programmers, i created my very first python project.
    In a nutshell, this project is a 4x4 board game that allows one to place buildings anywhere on the board until it is filled up.
    The main objective is to gain as many points as possible before the board is filled up and all game progress is saved with the click of a button. Other functions of the game would include being able to 
  see the current score and saved high scores.</p>
